I am a PhD student at [UKRI CDT in Speech and Language Technologies](https://slt-cdt.sheffield.ac.uk/) under the supervision of Prof. [Thomas Hain](https://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/T.Hain/) , University of Sheffield.  I am also a member of  [SPandH](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/spandh) and  [Machine Intelligence for Natural Interfaces (MINI)](https://mini.dcs.shef.ac.uk/)  research group. Currently, I am working on self-supervised learning for speech, disentangled speech representations, cost-effective self-supervised fine-tuning of self-supervised learning based speech models for task-specific speech representations. Acoustic word/sub-word embeddings.

Before joining my PhD, I worked as a senior data scientist at Publicis Sapient.  Before that,  I did my M.Tech (Research) from the Dept. of Electrical Engineering [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/) (IISc), Bangalore, working for [Medical Intelligence and Language Engineering (MILE)](http://mile.ee.iisc.ac.in/) lab under the supervision of  [Prof. A. G. Ramakrishnan](http://mile.ee.iisc.ac.in/AGR/index.htm). I was a project assoicate at the same lab after finishing my masters for 3 months. During my term at IISc, I have worked on various research topics like speaker recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing for social media , applied machine and deep learning for recognising cognitive impairments using clinical data, etc.
